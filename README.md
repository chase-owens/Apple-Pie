# Apple-Pie
Apple Pie is a word guessing game, similar to hangman, that is a bit more kid friendly.

## Project Details
Apple Pie begins with a picture of an apple tree with 7 apples with all letter options enabled. The Apple Pie was a project in the *App Development with Swift* course available in iBooks.
1. After letters are selected, they are disabled.
2. When the user correctly guesses, a letter it appears where the blanks are and they are awareded 3 points.
3. When the user guesses incorrectly, an apple falls from the tree.
4. When all the letters are correctly guessed and the word is showing the user gets 3 points. 
5. If all of the apples fall off the tree, the game resets and another word is provided.
